I love the term: `oblivious.`

With an unconscious state of awareness, things or situation can become largely unpredictable. What was once thought to be an impossible feat of achievement can be made possible. A stand of one's true character can be revealed. The positives and negativity intertwine to create challenges with which obstacles must be overcome.

Welcome to **Oblivious** and I am ***not Wilson.***
