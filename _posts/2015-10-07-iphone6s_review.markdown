`There have been far too many reviews of iPhone 6S now that it is out in the wild. Rest assure that I shall not even attempt to match the level of detail with others. This review is solely based on my experience after using it for one and a half weeks.`

### Background

I have been a continuous iPhone user since its inception. I love the `S` release as I feel that it represents a mature release of its external body and architecture, but more importantly, it introduced a groundbreaking technology to the world; Siri for 4S, Touch ID for 5S and 3D-touch for 6S. That being said, my previous iPhone before 6S was 5S.

### What I Like
- The second generation Touch ID. Not only do I **not** get a chance to see *notification* when pressing the *home* button, I was pleasantly surprised at how fast my payment goes through with Apple Pay. Simply place the phone (with screen blank) near the receiver and double-click the home button. Boom! The payment goes through.

- 128GB. I have 2 important reasons for upgrading to 6S. First is Apple Pay; I appreciate the anonymity and convenience when purchasing through Apple Pay. The more important excuse, however, is the absolutely ridiculous limited space of 16GB, which means that I have to constantly perform maintenance and backup hindering my ability to better use my time. Going from 16GB to 128GB provides me with a huge peace of mind.

- Siri. The addition of on-demand "Hey Siri" name calling at anytime is convenient, and perhaps a little fun when asking things like `what is 5 centillion squared` or `what is zero divided by zero.`

- Overall speed. The 2GB of memory helps a lot too.

- Larger screen. After pre-ordering the 6S during midnight 2 weeks before the release, I had a dilemma if 6S Plus would be a better option for an extra $100. I still question myself that question to this day.

- 3D Touch. I like the technology; not so much on the current use of it. I think users need to be re-educated or brainwashed. Apps should (and most will) implement this feature, but not all support it at the moment. To be honest, I still don't find myself using this often; although I like having to press the left side of screen to switch between apps versus pressing the *home* button.

### What I Dislike

- Occasional lagging when waking up the phone. The screen does not respond to my touch for a good few seconds.

- Restore from Backup. A good rule of thumb is to start the new phone fresh and gradually add apps and settings. I initially tried *restoring from backup* and found the phone to be slower.

- Hot Home Button. A relatively large number of users also [experience this issue.](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7247833) The screen went blank and the *home* button and touch ID becomes really hot. The power button does not wake the screen. The only way to recover this is to do a hard-reset by pressing both power and home button for 10-15 seconds to restart the phone. It happened once to me and I went to Apple Store for an exchange.

### Conclusion

Like most of the iPhone consumers, I like what 6S has to offer. The Live Photos is a good feature addition to make photography more fun. It has a reasonable and acceptable battery life when compared with 5S. If, however, the *Hot Home Button* issue comes back, I will not be hesitating to return the device and wait until Apple fixes the issue.
